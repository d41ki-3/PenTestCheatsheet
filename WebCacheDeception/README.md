# WebCacheDeception
## Outline
- **Cache keys**  
  When a cache receives an HTTP request, it must determine whether it can serve a cached response or if it needs to forward the request to the origin server. This decision is made by generating a "cache key" from elements of the HTTP request, typically including the URL path and query parameters, but potentially also other elements such as headers and content type.  
   If the incoming request's cache key matches that of a previous request, the cache considers them to be equivalent and serves a copy of the cached response.
