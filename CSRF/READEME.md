# How does CSRF work  
To exploit a CSRF vulnerability, several conditions must be met:  

1. Identify a Valuable Action: The attacker needs to find an action worth exploiting, such as changing the user's password, email, or elevating privileges.  
2. Session Management: The user's session should be managed solely through cookies or the HTTP Basic Authentication header, as other headers cannot be manipulated for this purpose.  
3. Absence of Unpredictable Parameters: The request should not contain unpredictable parameters, as they can prevent the attack.

1. Ð¡hange request method.
2. Just delete CSRF token.
3. CSRF token is not tied to the user session
4.
