# Methodology  
From : [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/xss-cross-site-scripting)
1. Check if any value you control (parameters, path, headers?, cookies?) is being reflected in the HTML or used by JS code.  
2. Find the context where it's reflected/used.  
3. If reflected
    1.  Check which symbols can you use and depending on that, prepare the payload:  
        1. In raw HTML:
            1. Can you create new HTML tags?
            2. Can you use events or attributes supporting `javascript:` protocol?
            3. Can you bypass protections?
            4. Is the HTML content being interpreted by any client side JS engine (AngularJS, VueJS, Mavo...), you could abuse a Client Side Template Injection.
            5. If you cannot create HTML tags that execute JS code, could you abuse a Dangling Markup - HTML scriptless injection?
        2.  Inside a HTML tag:  
            1. Can you exit to raw HTML context?  
            2. Can you create new events/attributes to execute JS code?
            3. Does the attribute where you are trapped support JS execution?
            4. Can you bypass protections?  
        3.  Inside JavaScript code:
            1. Can you escape the `<script>` tag?
            2. Can you escape the string and execute different JS code?
            3. Are your input in template literals ``?
            4. Can you bypass protections?  
        4.  Javascript function being executed
            1. You can indicate the name of the function to execute. e.g.: `?callback=alert(1)`
4. If used:
    1. You could exploit a DOM XSS, pay attention how your input is controlled and if your controlled input is used by any sink.
