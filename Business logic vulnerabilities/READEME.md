# Business logic
- Business logic vulnerabilities are flaws in an application's design and implementation that allow attackers to exploit legitimate functionality for malicious purposes. These vulnerabilities often arise from a failure to anticipate and safely handle unusual application states.  
- Flaws in the logic of an application can allow attackers to bypass intended rules. For example, they might complete a transaction without following the intended purchase process. Additionally, inadequate validation of user input might enable users to alter critical transaction values or submit nonsensical data. By providing unexpected inputs, attackers can manipulate the server-side logic to perform unintended actions.

2. Weak isolation on dual-use endpoint
