# GraphQL API vulnerabilities
[What is GraphQL?](https://portswigger.net/web-security/graphql/what-is-graphql)

GraphQL vulnerabilities often stem from implementation and design flaws. 
One such flaw is leaving the **introspection feature** active, which allows attackers to query the API and discover its schema.

GraphQL attacks typically involve sending malicious requests to obtain data or perform unauthorized actions. 
These attacks can have significant impacts, particularly if the attacker can elevate privileges (e.g., gaining admin access) 
through query manipulation or a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) exploit. 
Additionally, poorly secured GraphQL APIs can lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities, exposing sensitive data.
