# GraphQL API vulnerabilities
[What is GraphQL?](https://portswigger.net/web-security/graphql/what-is-graphql)

GraphQL vulnerabilities often stem from implementation and design flaws. 
One such flaw is leaving the **introspection feature** active, which allows attackers to query the API and discover its schema.

GraphQL attacks typically involve sending malicious requests to obtain data or perform unauthorized actions. 
These attacks can have significant impacts, particularly if the attacker can elevate privileges (e.g., gaining admin access) 
through query manipulation or a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) exploit. 
Additionally, poorly secured GraphQL APIs can lead to information disclosure vulnerabilities, exposing sensitive data.

## Finding GraphQL endpoints 
- **Universal queries**  
  When you send the query `query{__typename}` to any GraphQL endpoint, the response will include the string `{"data": {"__typename": "query"}}`. This is known as a **universal query**, and it's a useful tool to check whether a URL corresponds to a GraphQL service.
  
  This query works because every GraphQL endpoint has a reserved field called `__typename`, which returns the type of the queried object as a string.

- **Common endpoint names**  
  GraphQL services often have similar endpoint suffixes. When testing for GraphQL endpoints, you can send universal queries (like `query{__typename}`) to the following common locations:
  ```
  /graphql
  /api
  /api/graphql
  /graphql/api
  /graphql/graphql
  ```
  If these don't yield a GraphQL response, you can also try appending `/v1` to the path (e.g., `/graphql/v1`).

- **Request methods**  
  When trying to find GraphQL endpoints, it's important to test with different request methods. Best practice is for production GraphQL endpoints to only accept POST requests with a content-type of `application/json`, as this helps prevent CSRF vulnerabilities. However, some endpoints may also accept alternative methods, such as GET requests or POST requests with a content-type of `x-www-form-urlencoded`.
  
  If you can't locate the GraphQL endpoint with POST requests to common URLs, try sending the universal query using alternative HTTP methods.

- **Initial testing**  
  Once you've discovered the GraphQL endpoint, you can send test requests to gain insights into how it functions. If the endpoint powers a website, explore the web interface using Burp's browser and review the HTTP history to analyze the GraphQL queries that are being sent.
